Empowering Farmers Through Innovation,
Addressing Crop Damage and Soil Composition Monitoring

--PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

-> Crop Damage Mitigation:- Since India is an agricultural nation, as is well known, farmers encounter many difficulties in their work. One of the main causes of these difficulties is when animals or birds damage their crops, causing them to suffer significant losses, harming India's export economy, and decreasing farmer survival

-> Soil Composition Monitoring:- Additionally, farmers are unable to accurately monitor and understand the composition of the soil, which would enable them to grow high-yielding crops.

--PROPOSED SOLUTION:-

1.Advanced scarecrow with integrated soil monitoring for farms.

2.Motion sensors detect the invading movements of animals and birds on farmland and generate alert sounds while relaying emergency calls and SMS to the owner, as well as recording photos to analyze data from animal attacks.

3.Soil monitoring is done by sensors like humidity, moisture, temperature, NPK sensors, etc., whose data will be updated on the mobile app through IOT cloud. Machine learning models help in the data analysis and make crop prediction and provide report of the whole land based on the data.
